# TV Made Easy
- Central movie and show availability search
- Shows streaming service availability and prices 
- AI chatbox for streaming recommendations

This project idea will act as a central area for movies, TV, and streamable content. The main goal of this project idea is to provide people who may be intimidated by scrounging around google looking for info on entertainment, to have one single location to go. Looking up titles will show the streaming services theyâ€™re on and associated prices (ie rent on Prime). If someone wants recommendations, we were thinking of adding an AI chatbox, powered by the OpenAI API, to give people chances to branch out easily.

# Trip Planning Tool
- Allows for mileage planning based on EV charging gas stations etc
- Utilize Google maps
- Suggest national parks to visit on the way? (Potential for LLM chat if we want, they could add their area and get park recs.)
- Road Trip Packing List (Checklist)
- Weather warning around the trip area?
- Would be cool if we could get an estimated timeline of trip so you know what time you would be getting where and also so sleeping and rest could be taken into consideration- might be too complicated

This project idea will act as a central area for planning out a road trip through the USA. The main goal for this project is to make planning a road trip easier and saving our users time.  This project would have a spot for planning out destinations using the Google Map Api. Once destinations are selected, the user could put in the vehicle information and our project would do the math to help plan out where/when the user would need to get gas or recharge their car and help select the best path to hit all their destinations. The next part of planning a road trip is packing. Our project would have a started checklist with the basic items already on it that almost every human would need on a road trip. The user should be able to add and remove every item on the list as they desired though.

# D&D Character Creator and Campaign Planner
- Utilize D&D APIs to gather information into one location
- Allows players to roll a dice for skill checks, attacks, etc
- Players can create a random character or customize their own
- Assist players with level-ups
- Allows DM to create new monsters and track the campaign
- DM has a space for campaign notes and planning

This project idea will act as a resource for D&D players to create their characters for the campaign, and for DMs to plan and keep track of the campaign as it develops. The goal of the project is to create a resource that is beginner-friendly and assists in character creation as well as campaign planning. Users can use the random character creator function if they want to jump right in or use the in-depth creator for more customization. Players can also use the level-up feature to assist them with the steps to level up their character including new spells, feats, etc. DMs can generate a random monster for the players to fight, and keep track of their campaign notes. They can keep track of past and future events and the locations the players have visited or will be visiting.
